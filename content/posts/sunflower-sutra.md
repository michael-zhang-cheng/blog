If I should die by my fever,

at this ocean's sandy bed,

I won't protest a premature passing.

mother,

bury me deep in your sweetest abyss,

fill my lungs with foaming surf

let my ribs become a home

to fish and urchins black and bright

let the smallest creatures seek shelter

in the tangled nest of my hair

I'm tired of holding my feet steady

in the push and pull of the morning tide

soon I'll be a rush of salt and sand

a million multicolored me's and you's

so hold no funerals for our passing

mourn nothing and rejoice.

play music gently into dusk

so strangers might dance -dance

under the moon's flickering leaf-light
